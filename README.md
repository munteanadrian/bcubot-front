# BCUBot

A bot that I made and used for automating booking at a seat at my university's main library during exam session. Bookings had to be made on an old website with long wait times and errors and I was spending up to an hour and a half per day getting a seat for the next day, so I automated it.
## Features

- NextJS with TailwindCSS and Framer-Motion
- Responsive UI for small/medium/large screens
- Cookies used to save user ID on request
- Spring Web on the backend with a simple MVC architecture
- Selenium running headless Chrome for automation
- Handling for runtime and site-specific errors, edge cases
- Functionality for booking a seat (+ which seat) and deleting it
